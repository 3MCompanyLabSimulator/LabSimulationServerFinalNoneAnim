title :
 Magnetic Effect Simulation Experiment

description :
in this Experiment we will see that the metals are strongly attracted by a magnetic force.
The common ferromagnetic metals include iron, nickel, cobalt, and alloys such as steel.
on the other side, we will see some materials aren't atrracted by the magnetic force like galss and wood
