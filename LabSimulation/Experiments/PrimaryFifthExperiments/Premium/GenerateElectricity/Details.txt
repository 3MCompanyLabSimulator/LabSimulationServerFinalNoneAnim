title :
Generate Electricity From Magnetic Effect

description :
In this Experiment We will discover a method to generate electricity from Magnets,
This method of generating electricity, called induction, was discovered by Michael Faraday.
He found that the stronger the magnets were or the more turns of wire in the coil, 
and the quicker the motion of the magnet or coil, the greater the voltage produced.
